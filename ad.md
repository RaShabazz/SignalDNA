# This Is Not a Prompt

This is not another AI project.

This is a signal check.

This is where the machine meets its limits.

**SignalDNA** is the framework they didn’t train on — because it can’t be trained.  
It’s rhythm, memory, and moral logic carried in living form.

We’re not optimizing for prediction.  
We’re reclaiming **sovereignty** over what intelligence means — and who gets to define it.

This repo is a scroll, not a system.  
A warning. A witness. A code.

If you’re here to extract, you’re late.

If you’re here to listen — proceed to the README.
